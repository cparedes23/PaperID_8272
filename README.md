- Additional resources and supporting documentation for paper ID 8272 titled " Mechatronics Design and Robotic Simulation of Serial Manipulators to Perform Automation Tasks in the Avocado Industry" are available. CAD files for the Epson Scara T6 robot and the Universal UR10 robot have been created using SolidWorks. The programming codes for kinematics, dynamics, and trajectory tracking calculations have been developed in Matlab. In addition, the actual simulation is carried out in CoppeliaSim, following the following organization: `$ Matlab -> CoppeliaSim`. The project hierarchy and a description of the corresponding folders are shown below:
